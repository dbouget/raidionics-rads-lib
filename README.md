The code corresponds to the Raidionics backend for running processing pipelines over MRI/CT scans. The segmentation of
a few organs or tumor types, as well as the generation of standardized reports are included.  
The module can either be used as a Python library, as CLI, or as Docker container.

## [Usage](https://github.com/dbouget/raidionics_rads_lib#usage)
</summary>

## CLI
```
raidionicsrads CONFIG
```

CONFIG should point to a configuration file (*.ini), specifying all runtime parameters,
according to the pattern from [**blank_main_config.ini**](https://github.com/dbouget/raidionics-rads-lib/blob/master/blank_main_config.ini).

## Python module
```
from raidionicsrads.compute import run_rads
run_rads(config_filename="/path/to/main_config.ini")
```

## Docker
:warning: The Docker image can only perform inference using the CPU, there is no GPU support at this stage.
```
docker pull dbouget/raidionics-rads:v1.1
```

For opening the Docker image and interacting with it, run:  
```
docker run --entrypoint /bin/bash -v /home/<username>/<resources_path>:/home/ubuntu/resources -t -i --runtime=nvidia --network=host --ipc=host dbouget/raidionics-rads:v1.1
```

The `/home/<username>/<resources_path>` before the column sign has to be changed to match a directory on your local 
machine containing the data to expose to the docker image. Namely, it must contain folder(s) with images you want to 
run inference on, as long as a folder with the trained models to use, and a destination folder where the results will 
be placed.

For launching the Docker image as a CLI, run:  
```
docker run -v /home/<username>/<resources_path>:/home/ubuntu/resources -t -i --runtime=nvidia --network=host --ipc=host dbouget/raidionics-rads:v1.1 -c /home/ubuntu/resources/<path>/<to>/main_config.ini -v <verbose>
```

The `<path>/<to>/main_config.ini` must point to a valid configuration file on your machine, as a relative path to the `/home/<username>/<resources_path>` described above.
For example, if the file is located on my machine under `/home/myuser/Data/RADS/main_config.ini`, 
and that `/home/myuser/Data` is the mounted resources partition mounted on the Docker image, the new relative path will be `RADS/main_config.ini`.  
The `<verbose>` level can be selected from [debug, info, warning, error].

# Models
</summary>

The trained models are automatically downloaded when running Raidionics or Raidionics-Slicer.
Alternatively, all existing Raidionics models can be browsed [here](https://github.com/dbouget/Raidionics-models/releases/tag/1.2.0) directly.

# Developers
</summary>

```
git clone https://github.com/dbouget/raidionics_rads_lib.git --recurse-submodules
```
For running inference on GPU through the raidionics_seg_lib backend, your machine must be properly configured
(cf. [here](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/CUDA-ExecutionProvider.html))  

The ANTs library can be manually installed (from source) and be used as a cpp backend rather than Python.
